Framework Used: Flask

Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro-framework used for developing web applications in Python.
Database Connection:

The API establishes a connection to a MongoDB instance using pymongo.MongoClient.
MongoDB URI: mongodb://localhost:27017/
Database Query:

It accesses the MongoDB admin database and the TEST collection.
The collection.find({}) method fetches all documents from the TEST collection.
Data Retrieval:

It iterates through the query result and constructs a string representation of the data.
The output data is JSON-like, where single quotes are replaced with double quotes.
API Endpoint:

The Flask app defines an endpoint /fetch with the HTTP GET method.
When accessed via a GET request, it invokes the fetch() function, which fetches data from MongoDB.
Response:

The fetched data from MongoDB is returned as a response to the API call made to the /fetch endpoint.
Server Initialization:

The Flask app is configured to run in debug mode, facilitating debugging with detailed error messages.
