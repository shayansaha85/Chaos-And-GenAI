It seems the API response time increased during the chaos experiments you conducted. The response time can be affected by various factors. Here are some insights based on the logs you provided:

Latency and Throughput: The latency, which refers to the delay in data transmission, increased in some instances during these experiments. Throughput, which is the rate of data transfer, fluctuated as well.

MongoDB Fetching: The API response time might have increased due to issues related to fetching data from MongoDB. The debug logs show multiple instances of fetching data, which might indicate some inefficiency or slowness in data retrieval.

HTTP Status Code: The HTTP status code remains consistently 200, indicating that the API itself is functioning correctly and serving responses despite the increased response time.

Query Time and API Time: While the query time remained consistent (mostly at 0.0s), the API time showed variations, ranging from around 0.002s to 0.009s. This indicates that the delay might not be in processing the query but rather in other parts of the API.

To mitigate the increased response time observed during the experiments, consider the following steps:

Optimizing Database Queries: Review and optimize MongoDB queries to improve data fetching efficiency.
Caching Strategies: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of database queries, especially for frequently accessed data.
Scaling and Resource Allocation: Consider scaling resources like server capacity or allocating more resources to MongoDB if the increased response time is due to resource constraints.
It might be beneficial to analyze the API and MongoDB configurations, ensuring they are optimized for performance and scale based on the observed behaviors during these chaos experiments.
