# MongoDB Chaos Experiment Documentation
## Experiment Title: Connection Overload

### Objective:
Simulate an overload of incoming connections to analyze MongoDB's behavior under high connection pressure.

### Steps:
1. **Preparation:**
   - Ensure MongoDB instance is running and accessible.

2. **Simulation:**
   - Use a Python script to create a large number of simultaneous connections to the MongoDB instance.
   - Monitor MongoDB metrics during the simulation.

3. **Observations:**
   - Record the behavior of MongoDB metrics (Connections, Network Traffic, Memory Usage, etc.) during the connection overload.
   - Note any performance degradation, rejected connections, or impact on existing operations.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Analyze the collected metrics to understand MongoDB's response to high connection loads.
   - Identify any bottlenecks, performance degradation, or unexpected behaviors.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize findings, lessons learned, and potential recommendations for optimizing MongoDB under high connection loads.

### Tools Used:
- Python scripting for simulating connection overload.
- MongoDB monitoring tools for observing and collecting metrics.

## Results:

### Metrics Observed:
- **Connections:** Increased totalCreated and rejected connections.
- **Network Traffic:** Spikes in bytesIn and bytesOut.
- **Memory Usage:** Potential increase in resident and virtual memory usage.
- **Locks:** Possible contention or increased acquisition counts.

### Observations:
- MongoDB handled up to [X number] of simultaneous connections before rejecting.
- Increased response times observed under high load.
- Some operations experienced delays or timeouts.

### Analysis:
- High connection pressure led to increased rejection rates.
- MongoDB maintained stability but showed performance degradation under extreme load.

### Conclusion:
- MongoDB can handle a substantial number of connections but exhibits degradation beyond a certain threshold.
- Recommendations for optimization include connection pooling and resource scaling.
