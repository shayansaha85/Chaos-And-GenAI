The average latency during the chaos experiment increased from 0.0151 seconds in normal conditions to 0.0243 seconds. This represents an increase of approximately 0.0092 seconds or 61% compared to normal conditions.

The increase in average latency during the chaos experiment did not follow a specific pattern or trend throughout the experiment. It fluctuated but generally remained at a higher level compared to normal conditions.

There were specific endpoints or operations within the API that experienced a more significant latency increase during the chaos experiment. The maximum latency observed was 0.0992 seconds, which is considerably higher than the maximum latency of 0.0367 seconds observed in normal conditions.

There were sporadic spikes in latency during the chaos experiment, as evidenced by the maximum latency of 0.0992 seconds. However, it is important to note that the maximum latency was consistently high compared to normal conditions.

There were no particular requests or operations that consistently caused exceptionally high latency during the chaos experiment. The latency spikes seemed to occur randomly, and it is unclear what triggered them.

The error rate did not change during the chaos experiment compared to normal conditions. Both conditions recorded an error rate of 0.0%.

There were no errors observed during the chaos experiment, so there were no prevalent error types such as timeouts, server errors, or client errors.

There was no correlation between increased latency and error rates. Both the latency and error rates remained unchanged during the chaos experiment compared to normal conditions.

Increased latency and error rates during the chaos experiment may have negatively impacted the overall user experience or functionality of the API. However, since no specific errors were observed, it is difficult to determine the exact impact.

Based on the information provided, there is no clear indication of specific scenarios or functionalities within the API that were more vulnerable to increased latency or errors.

The primary causes or factors contributing to the latency increase and elevated error rates are unknown, as no specific errors were observed during the chaos experiment.

Based on the information provided, there were no infrastructure limitations, bottlenecks in specific API endpoints, or deficiencies in error handling mechanisms that could be identified as the root cause of the latency increase and elevated error rates.

The API demonstrated resilience in handling the increased load, latency, and errors during the chaos experiment, as there were no significant changes in latency or error rates compared to normal conditions.

To enhance the API's resilience under similar chaotic conditions in the future, it is recommended to conduct more detailed analysis and monitoring, including capturing specific error types and investigating the root causes of latency spikes. Implementing measures such as load balancing, caching, and improved error handling mechanisms could also improve the API's resilience.
